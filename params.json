{"name":"Transponder","tagline":"Transponder is a opinionated javascript library for assisting in working with front end heavy rails app.","body":"# Transponder\r\nTransponder uncompressed is about 8kb uncompressed / 2kb minified & compressed (gzip) \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'transponder'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install transponder\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThere are 3 types of transponder module, minimal, basic, full by using the ```-t``` flag you can specify which type you want to use. If you don't specify a ```-t``` flag it will generate a basic module.\r\n\r\n### Minimal\r\nMinimal transponder modules are good for generating modules that will contain only services that will be used by other modules. Generally recommended to use in combination with the ```--shared``` flag\r\n\r\n    $ rails g transponder:install utilities -t minimal --shared\r\n\r\n### Basic\r\nBasic transponder modules come with 3 basic things, helpers, services, and presenters. If you want to work with rails controller you will need to use the basic module type.\r\n\r\n    $ rails g transponder:install application\r\n\r\n### Full\r\nFull transponder modules come with transponder's primitives and placeholders for a backbone app, it will setup the integration for a backbone app into your transponder module.\r\n\r\n    $ rails g transponder:install application -t full\r\n\r\n## Primitives\r\n\r\n### Presenters\r\nPresenter's jobs are to take the response from the server usually html fragment that is rendered by rails and output it to the screen. The reason why we have presenters is so that we can do things to the content before outputting it.\r\n\r\nPresenters usually map to your controller action in rails. By default it supports the 7 basic restful actions \r\n\r\n+ index\r\n+ new\r\n+ edit\r\n+ show\r\n+ create\r\n+ update\r\n+ destroy\r\n\r\nHowever you can override this and add your own custom presenter actions if you want. Its not necessary that the presenter action maps to your rails controller action.\r\n\r\n### Services\r\nServices are things that apply to alot of items on the page. You could think of these parts of the page as 'widget' and they all have a certain kind of behavior. The behavior of these widgets can be defined by services. Each widget can have the behavior of multiple services.\r\n\r\nSome example of services\r\n\r\n+ File uploader\r\n+ Poller\r\n+ Push notification subscriber\r\n+ Syntax Highlighter\r\n+ Search Bar\r\n\r\nServices are very modular and they can be applied to multiple widgets in a page without conflicting with each other and without rebinding widgets that already have these behaviors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO - Whats Coming\r\n\r\n  + Clean up some APIs\r\n  + Add Documentation\r\n  + Video Screencasts\r\n  + More Generators\r\n  + Example Rails Project\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
